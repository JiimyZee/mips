## Specification

This MIP102c2 Subproposal does not seek to amend Article 1 of a Scope Bounded Mutable Alignment Artifact. It is thus considered a General Edit. An MIP102c2 General Edit cannot modify Article 1 elements.

### Motivation

This subproposal will amend MIP113 Section 5.2, to include a new procedure to allow AVC members to relinquish their role.

### Amended MIPs and Components

* MIP 113 Section 5
  * 5.2: Aligned Voter Committee Member Recognition
